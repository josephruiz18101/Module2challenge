    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p id="AboutMe">Hi, my name is Joseph Ruiz I am 24, originally from Albuquerque New Mexico I was born and raised
        there. I lived there for 19 years until I met my beautiful wife and married a year later. I also moved to Texas
        during that time. I have a dog named Kuro and my favorite hobbies are cars, watching anime, and gaming. I have
        done many jobs in the food industry, I was a prison guard once and then I worked on cars, I was a lube tech. My
        favorite food is anything with New Mexico green chile since I canâ€™t get it when I want. My favorite video game
        is Monster Hunter, I enjoy playing League of Legends with my wife as well. I always wanted to have a business,
        like an anime store or something, but I needed a career to take care of my family so I started doing a web
        development boot camp.</p>
    <h2>Work</h2>
    <p id="Work">I work at Wingman Oil Change as a lube tech, my responsibilities are vehicle inspection, fluid
        top-offs, and oil lubricant changes. I am the technician in the basement of the shop, removing the drain plugs
